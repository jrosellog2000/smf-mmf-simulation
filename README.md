# SMF and MMF Fiber Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB (toolbox-free) simulations of:

- Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)
- Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)

The simulations are based on:
- Weakly guiding approximation
- LP modes
- Gaussian approximation for SMF
- Bessel-function-based modes for MMF

## Requirements
- MATLAB (base installation, no paid toolboxes)

## Structure
